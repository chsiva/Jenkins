Pipeline {
  agent <name-here> specify on which node/server. If any (will automatically choose available node) or else specify label-name on node.
  environment - default values like version number, config path. which will be defined as environment variables for all steps, or stage-specific steps, depending on where the environment directive is located within the Pipeline
  parameters - variables(dynamically pass)
  stage - Practically speaking, all of the real work done by a Pipeline will be wrapped in one or more stage directives
  stages - Stages in Declarative Pipeline may have a stages section containing a list of nested stages to be run in sequential order.
  steps - Declarative Pipelines may use all the available steps documented in the Pipeline Steps reference, which contains a comprehensive list of steps, with the addition of the steps listed below which are only supported in Declarative Pipeline.
  script - The script step takes a block of Scripted Pipeline and executes that in the Declarative Pipeline. For most use-cases, the script step should be unnecessary in Declarative Pipelines, but it can provide a useful "escape hatch." script blocks of non-trivial size and/or complexity should be moved into Shared Libraries instead.

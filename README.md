# Introduction to Declarative Pipelines

## https://github.com/cloudbees/intro-to-declarative-pipeline

This repository contains the instructions and learning materials associated with a hands on training workshop called **Introduction to Declarative Pipelines** that is designed to teach the following key concepts:

  * What are Jenkins Pipelines and why should you use them?
  * Why should you use [Declarative](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#declarative-pipeline) vs [Scripted](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#scripted-pipeline) pipelines?
  * What tools are available for creating pipelines?
  * How can you create a simple pipeline via Jenkins?
  * What are the key features of Declarative pipelines?
  * How do you create multibranch pipelinest?
  * How do you  create a pipeline using Blue Ocean's pipeline editor?
  * What are Distributed Pipelines - an architecture that distributes your Pipelines by providing per team Jenkins Masters
  * CloudBees Pipeline features that enable and enhance **Distributed Pipelines**
  
A PDF version of the presentation that accompanies this workshop can be found here: [Introduction%20to%20Declarative%20Pipeline%20-%20Hands%20On.pdf](Introduction%20to%20Declarative%20Pipeline%20-%20Hands%20On.pdf)
